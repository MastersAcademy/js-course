  "description": "As I born developer, frontend came naturally. Though it was a childhood hobby, I was fortunate enough to choose javascript as a future-defining career without a second thought. I started to relish life like never before. The skills that set me apart - a keen eye, quick thinker, good listener, fast learner and a perfectionist... All these qualities added Almighty's blessings, made me, 'The Developer'- that I am today."
